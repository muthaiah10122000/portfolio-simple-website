I created my first personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code. This project showcases my front-end development skills and serves as a platform to present my projects, skills, and contact details. The website is fully responsive and designed with a clean, modern layout to ensure a smooth user experience. Building this portfolio helped me strengthen my understanding of web structure, semantic HTML, and CSS styling techniques.
